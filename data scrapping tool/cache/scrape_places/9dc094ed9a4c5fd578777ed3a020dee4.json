After dinner we went for window shopping and then returned to the parking area where we had parked our car.\nThe mall is maintained very well, cleanliness is maintained in restrooms and also inside the entire mall.\nOverall, the mall is not that huge but it gets very crowded during the weekend.

Set over three floors, the size of the season mall is a great positive as this creates an excellent shopping experiences with lots of beautiful stores. The Cinepolis multiplex is on 2nd floor which is well designed at the corner of floor which makes mall spacious and free from rush or buzz.\nGood [P] parking possibilities at arrival even though on a busy Saturday.\n\nWe enjoyed the food court at the upper floor. As well as the mall best for kids as Timezone for adults as well as kids, infant, babies play area was on 3rd floor. High number of selections - all looking , clean  and with common sitting area in the middle.\n\nWe enjoyed at burger King and Tea post.\n\nShops easy to find on good maps at the escalators as well as  Elevators.\n\nOverall seasons mall fulls ur weekend with seasoning memories.

Multiplex, bar, Coffee Shops ...... almost everything is there. Was pleasantly surprised to see a Harley Davidson Showroom in the Mall. Mall is very well made, with great big lobby and a shining centrepiece which acentuates the grandeur of the Mall. The dome is really huge and impressive. Good many interesting spots for Social Media reels. The best part was that even in the evening primetime, there was hardly any crowd. No justling or pushing around as we are accustomed to in other big Malls. Enough people to not give it a deserted look and at the same just enough to let you have some freedom of space. But sadly once we step outside, the streets of Pune are choc-a-bloc with traffic and blaring horns and everyone in a hurry to get somewhere.",

                    "review_text": "Very nice and big Mall. Has most of the brands for Shopping. Food Court is decent sized with limited but good options. Multiplex, bar, Coffee Shops ...... almost everything is there. Was pleasantly surprised to see a Harley Davidson Showroom in the Mall. Mall is very well made, with great big lobby and a shining centrepiece which acentuates the grandeur of the Mall. The dome is really huge and impressive. Good many interesting spots for Social Media reels. The best part was that even in the evening primetime, there was hardly any crowd. No justling or pushing around as we are accustomed to in other big Malls. Enough people to not give it a deserted look and at the same just enough to let you have some freedom of space. But sadly once we step outside, the streets of Pune are choc-a-bloc with traffic and blaring horns and everyone in a hurry to get somewhere.",
