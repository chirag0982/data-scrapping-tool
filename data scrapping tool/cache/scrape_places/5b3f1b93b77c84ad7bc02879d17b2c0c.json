Yeah Starbucks is a brand but it is pricey and from past few years prices of coffee and other things have gone up considerably.\n\nCoffee is good, but can be better given the premium they charge. The cold coffee was also ok types, I expected them to add sugar in the cold coffee atleast, We spent almost 20 minutes and 4-5 sachets of sugar to make it taste better. Pretty difficult to mix sugar in cold coffee, they should know about it.\n\nThe sandwich was also okayish, newyork cheese cake was yummy. So overall it was ok experience. I will definitely rethink going Starbucks next time and give chance to new independent cafes, that gave quality for the price.\n\nThis space is good for couples and big groups. I was missing the light music and the cosy sittings that other Starbucks outlets in Pune offers.",
